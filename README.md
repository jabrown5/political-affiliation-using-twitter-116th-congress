## 116th Congress Members Twitter Data: Identifying Groupings using Unsupervised Learning

## Problem Statement

*It's a well known fact that the United States of America has two major political parties: Republican and Democrat. While there may be a few Independents here and there, the USA political system is governed by these two major parties. But, while Congress persons affiliate with one of these two political parties, do their tweet data say otherwise? Specifically, does a congress persons archive of tweets group them differently to just Republican or Democrat? Based on the language used in an archive of tweets, do they group along lines that are not simply Republican or Democrat?**

## Background and Executive Summary

Tweet data for all active members of the 116th Congress were collected and collated into one documuent for each individual. Several unsupervised learning models were employed to see whether the text data could be used to create unique groupings that, perhaps, differ from the traditional two party system of Republican and Democrat.

### Data

This project employs data scraped from the [*Tweets of Congress*](https://github.com/alexlitel/congresstweets) GitHub which collects daily tweets for all members of Congress and affiliates. Tweets of interest were for members of the [*116th Congress*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/116th_United_States_Congress) only which was in session from January 3, 2019 to January 3, 2021. Twitter handles for these Congress persons were also [*collected*](https://www.sbh4all.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/116th-Congress-Twitter-Handles.pdf) and merged onto the tweet data.  

In total, about 1.5 million unique tweets were collected.
