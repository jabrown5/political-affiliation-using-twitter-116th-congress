committing a federal crime its a good idea to be friends with President Trump and thats simply not how its supposed to work  These pardons arent about helping their recipients theyre about helping the President This could lead to a backlash that inhibits future presidents from granting clemency to actually deserving people We need to fight back against that reaction while properly condemning these

sleep with his brother in law so he can film it and give the tape to his sister during her sons engagement party Makes you wonder how long until he tweets about Benedict Arnold being treated unfairly  QT  THREAD Remember that Manafort was the linchpin of Russias efforts with the Trump campaign He was the one with direct contacts with Russian intel He was the one sharing info with them He was the one who owed a Russian oligarch 10mbut worked for the campaign for free 1 And somehow it seemed inevitable so long as he remained in office because it was all always about who could help or hurt him  QT  Manafort worked for Russia to attack the United States probably just for money in the final analysis Trump knew Trump helped And now Trump has pardoned Manafort with full knowledge that he was

crucial step in defeating the disease  Im glad  took this step to remind us that the vaccine is safe effective and essential for everyone to get when they have the chance Congress needs to continue supporting production and distribution to make that happen as soon as possible  This years NDAA secures servicemember pay raises and keeps crucial programs running Thats why it passed with bipartisan support Yet President Trump vetoed it because it would rename military bases that currently honor Confederate leaders Defeating this pandemic requires a more concerted united effort than weve mustered so far Even with vaccinations beginning we need to do more to contain the virus  And the sources for this story are people already working closely with the President These officials tell me that Trump is spending too much time with people they consider crackpots or conspiracy theorists and flirting with blatant abuses of power  A disturbing important read  The Republican party seems disjointed given that Republican leadership in Congress spent the past few months trying to reduce the size of individual stimulus checks in the COVID19 bill and now the President is angry because the checks arent big enough Octopi are making a last minute run at becoming 2020s official mascot  QT  Scientists have discovered that on occasions an octopus will punch a fish for no reason other than spite

Americans and is long overdue I also expressed my concern that President Trump has not responded to Russias hack of US government agencies   Why hasnt President Trump commented on this longterm indepth hack of US agencies by Russia The Presidents most important role is to protect the US government from adversaries  This behavior is unacceptable We must work to ensure those who are at greatest risk to the virus get it first and not allow the wealthy and wellconnected to jump the line  Today we celebrate the Winter Solstice which marks the first day of winter in the Northern Hemisphere as well as the shortest day of the year Happy Solstice The owners of Purdue Pharma knew the ramifications of their drug OxyContin and they made attempts to financially protect themselves from the lawsuits they knew would be coming In our Oversight Committee hearing they expressed little remorse  Some of the priorities that the White House advocated for in the new COVID19 relief bill

have lost the 2020 Election Big protest in DC on January 6th Be there will be wild Last month Purdue Pharma pleaded guilty to conspiring to mislead regulators and paying illegal kickbacks to doctors But in our Oversight Committee hearing yesterday they refused to apologize for their role in the opioid crisis In the course of failing to usurp the presidency  Trump succeeded at usurping the Republican Party On that front his accomplishments since November 3 have been impressive President Trump has shown us that his priority as his Administration ends is making sure all his associates are protected from rightful criminal prosecution I think wed all prefer he spend his time on other issues  for example the pandemic  Time after time Republicans have attempted to limit voting rights Three lawsuits have been filed regarding absentee ballots in Georgias runoff Senate elections There is little evidence of voter fraud in the US so obviously theres another goal there As I explained in this

field  Democracy may have tenuously held but almost half the country will continue to believe Trumps debunked claims  and Trump hopes keep adding to the more than 200 million that he has raised from his supporters since Election Day I am truly outraged that even while the owners of the company that makes OxyContin admitted their drugs have fueled the national opioid crisis in this country they outright refused to either admit what they did was wrong or even apologize for it  I am disgusted that when I asked Purdue Pharma CEO Craig Landau in todays  hearing whether he would forgo the 3 million bonus he will receive at the expense of victims of the opioid crisis he refused to say he would   I also asked David Sackler in todays  hearing about the multimillion dollar properties he purchased as opioid overdose deaths continued to rise   In todays  hearing on The Role of Purdue Pharma and the Sackler Family in the Opioid Epidemic I asked members of the Sackler family about emails

expiration of the federal eviction ban will disproportionately impact Black and Latino tenants just as COVID19 has That is why I wrote a letter to the CDC Director requesting that the eviction moratorium be extended  The proTrump disinformation playbook is moving on to vaccine commentary The latest belief is that the COVID19 vaccine has a microchip to track people The notion would be comical if it wasnt so scary how fast disinformation spreads   This story on the CDC is one were all aware of because its happened many times with this Administration an agency created to protect the nation against a public health catastrophe like the coronavirus was largely stifled by the Trump administration Without Congressional relief we have left our military families in the dark At Fort Bragg the YMCA food bank has seen a 40 increase in requests for groceries Food insecurity requires massive assistance not a piecemeal response  Im concerned that President Trump who constantly claims hes a worldclass negotiator passed on Pfizers repeated offers to purchase additional vaccines The American people want and need adequate supply of COVID19 vaccine  Under the previous rule the immediate living space of species designated as endangered or threatened was protected But the Trump Administration has a new rule to shrink those protections and redefine the coverage to only a critical habitat Secretary of State Mike Pompeo invited over 900 guests to his indoor holiday party and only less than 70 attended Im guessing thats because the event had superspreader written all over it  but thats just a guess Convincing Black Americans scarred by generations of healthcare discrimination to trust the vaccine is a crucial part of ending the pandemic which has disproportionately impacted Black Americans Latinos and frontline workers Everyone in the room felt that profound moment when the first doses of the COVID19 vaccine were administered It will take months for us to vaccinate the entire US population so I ask that we all be patient and well get through this together  OnThisDay in 1773 American colonists staged an important protest and dumped 342

negotiate for a lower price This is a failure of leadership The TrumpAdmin grossly mishandled procurement of muchneeded ventilators and cost the American people millions of dollars The TrumpAdmin then decided to negotiate a completely NEW contract for the SAME kind of ventilators for 15K EACH This is NEARLY 5X the original cost Under the Obamaera contract  was required to provide  with 10K
